Our good friend Maxim made a shell script that parses poetry files. 

Structure

This repository has three folders: 

1. `poetry-collab/notes` contains notes documenting our meetings and research. 
2. `poetry-collab/scripts` contains shell scripts that will give us information
   on the poems. 
3. `poetry-collab/poems` contains files with poems that we like and want to
   analyze.
